    Intelligent Search Results 

Assumptions
    A Dynamo Db exists. 
    We make no presumptions about the database. 
    We are given correct keys. 
    Users know how to use this microservice, so some keys might be better suited for recursive searches than other keys?

Goals:
    
    1. Return Exact Search Result/Results or  Return Closest Search Result/Results. 

        -   Return data with a csv format. 
        -   Return data in a raw format. 
            
    2. Customisable result generator with either Exact Searches / Closest Search Results. 

        -   Can return multiple different columns, whereby the Exact operation was performed on 
            one column key. 
        
        -   In the scenario where Closest Search Result was performed, we can take a limit value and 
            return limit closest calues to the given search result for the specified column key. 
        
        -   We can perform closest recursive searches which can also have branches for a specified key. 
            So given key X, perform closest search for "description", it will then find the limit number 
            of results which are closest to the "description". If you have the branch option, then we recursively 
            perform the same operation for those results.  ("Intelligent Aspect")
    
    3.  It will also tell the user what exact names for given tags have not been found, and prompt them to 
        update there database. 


Inputs:
    List of Keys to return results for : [],
    Specified Key : String, 
    Closest Or Exact Search Flag : 0, 
    Limit : Int,
    CSV Flag : 0,
    Recursive Flag : 0
