StockValuePredictionFunctionality:

	Goals:
		1. Scrape data from Yahoo Finance, update database

		2. Return stock prediction information given user query input

	Goal 1: Scrape data from Yahoo Finance and update finance database in real time

		This engine is run in a separate thread (possibly multiple threads) to the user query system, and continuously scrapes the web API and updates the database. Current day price is updated every minute.

		Input: use query, indicating the desired stock to scrape, the timeframe (going back from the present), and the unit of time (e.g. Milliseconds, hours, days)


	Goal 2: Given user input, run ML prediction model (probably LSTM in Keras, but to be confirmed).

	Input: High, low and closing price, adjusted closing price
	Output: LSTM
